# Frogger

This is a project on Udacity Nano degree. You can try a little fun of it.

# Quickstart

### Install

  - Down load the all the files.
  - Open index.html using browser that support canvas.  Almost any modern supports canvas. If you don't know what  to choose, just try Google Chrome.

### How to play?

#### Command Line

 - After opening the index.html file, you only need to press your arrow keys on the key bord to move the player up and down, left or right.
 - You can see the scores, levels and the lives information on the top of the screen.
 - Your goal is to  cross the rock road to reach the river. Once you reach the river, you will get 100 points score. When you get every 500 points, you  are credited one more life and the levels increases one.




### Issues

 - There are a lot of features that can be added to this project. One appearant thing is that you when lives get down to /below 0 , you can still play the game.

Have fun!
